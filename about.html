<h2>Buy Paid License & Help Attract New Users To Stimulate Further Development!</h2>

    There is really a lot to be done on this extension. Below are some notable features that is planed for upcoming releases:
    <ol>
        <li>Node multiselect operations for manipulating nodes in sets.
        <li>Undo/Redo functionality to undo accidental changes. Note that you can undo an occasional window or tab closure by using Chrome's "Reopen closed" functionality. </li>
        <li>Ability to mark nodes with different icons (convenient for assigning importance, priority, or additional meaning; this also will prevent tab nodes from autodeleting after close).</li>
        <li>Additional ways to highlight nodes: custom styles, colors, borders, backgrounds, tags.
        <li>Additional rich editing features for notes: changing color, font size, rich text, multiline notes and so on.
        <li>Ability to convert any tab to locally saved image/document(mhtml) with a single button click (for offline access or to preserve changing information).
    </ol>

<p>The funds which will be earned by selling to you the Pro licenses will provides development of new powerful features.
    Not to mention that this of course instantly enable powerful already implemented abilities and usages.
    So you are very welcomed to switch to the paid version of this tool.


<p>Spreading the word about this extension will also help a great deal!
   By recommending this extension to your friends you not only stimulate development, you might actually help them!

   And for tab-addicts (people who constantly have several hundred tabs open) this extension is really a lifesaver!
